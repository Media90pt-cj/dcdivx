Fixed Point (integer) based Ogg Vorbis audio decoder

To generate the original floating point decoder, simply comment  out the
definition of FIXED_POINT in fixp.h.  This is handy to compare results if
some streams appear not to play correctly.  I'll be interested in any Vorbis
stream that doesn't produce the same result with both modes.
